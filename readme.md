# The Knowledge Filter

## A revival of a knock-off of a niche genre of humor website popular in the early 2000s.

### Concept

When completed, the Knowledge Filter will be a web app in which users can submit questions, any sort of questions they care to come up with, and they will get back answers in the form of a message board style thread featuring disparate personas to humorous effect.

The personas could be anything; characters original to the site, fictional characters, real-world personalities such as politicians or celebrities, inanimate objects, emothis, you name it. With the user's question as a jumping off point they will have some kind of discussion and, if the user is very lucky, they may even answer the question.

The idea is that, behind the scenes users with admin privileges will be taking a look at the submitted questions, and if they see a good one they will start writing response threads. They may use pre-existing personas or create some new ones as needed, whatever might be a good gag. The admin will then publish the question to the main page for all to see.

### MVP User Stories

- As a Visitor or a User (AAU/V) I want to see a list of already posted question threads, and click on them to see the full thread.

- As a User (AAU) I would like to submit a question.

- As an Admin (AAA) I would like to go to the admin view to see a list of submitted questions, both published and unpublished.

- AAA, I would like to edit any given question, either to publish/unpublish it, edit the thread, or delete it altogether.

### Stretch User Stories

- AAU, I would like to view my profile, perhaps to change my alias or icon.

- AAU, I would like to 'like' threads I enjoy, and see how many 'likes' any given thread has gotten.

- AAU, I would like to 'favorite' the very best threads, and see a list of them in my profile to re-read them later.

- AAA, I would like to reorganize the order of the 'posts' of an answer thread.
